# Taskberry

Taskberry is a MERN stack Todo App that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored in a database on www.mongodb.com.

Taskberry features a pleasant UI with strawberry vibes :).

> All tasks are publicly accessible. If you try the app from my demo version on Netlify, be mindful of what you post! Feel free to leave a nice message to brighten another user's day :D
